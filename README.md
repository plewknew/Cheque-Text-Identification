# Cheque Text Identification 
 
 The purpose of this repo is to explore the potential use of the Azure text recognition model as a way to identify where and what the text is on a cheque. This could be used to verify or identify individuals based on the name and text inputted.
 
 One additional potential extension of this project is to do some basic identification on an individual's signature. If someone submits a signature that is unlike the previous signatures that they submitted, it could be flagged as being potentially fraudulent.
